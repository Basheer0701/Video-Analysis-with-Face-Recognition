# Video Analysis with Face Recognition

This project demonstrates real-time video analysis using face recognition to identify and track faces from a webcam feed. It uses Python libraries like OpenCV and `face_recognition` for detecting and recognizing faces based on preloaded images.

## Features

- **Face Detection:** Detects faces in live video feed from a webcam.
- **Face Recognition:** Matches detected faces with preloaded images.
- **Unknown Faces:** Identifies faces not found in the database.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Processes video frames in real-time.
